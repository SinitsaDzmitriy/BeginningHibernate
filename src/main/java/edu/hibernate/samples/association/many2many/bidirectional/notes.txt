    A bidirectional @ManyToMany association has an owning and a mappedBy side. To
preserve synchronicity between both sides, it’s good practice to provide helper
methods for adding or removing child entities.
    If a bidirectional @OneToMany association performs better when removing or
changing the order of child elements, the @ManyToMany relationship cannot benefit
from such an optimization because the foreign key side is not in control. To
overcome this limitation, the link table must be directly exposed and the
@ManyToMany association split into two bidirectional @OneToMany relationships.
