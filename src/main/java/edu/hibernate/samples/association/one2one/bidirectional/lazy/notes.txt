    Although you might annotate the parent-side association to be fetched lazily,
Hibernate cannot honor this request since it cannot know whether the association is
null or not.
    The only way to figure out whether there is an associated record on the child
side is to fetch the child association using a secondary query. Because this can
lead to N+1 query issues, it’s much more efficient to use unidirectional @OneToOne
associations with the @MapsId annotation in place.
    However, if you really need to use a bidirectional association and want to
make sure that this is always going to be fetched lazily, then you need to enable
lazy state initialization bytecode enhancement and use the @LazyToOne annotation
as well.
