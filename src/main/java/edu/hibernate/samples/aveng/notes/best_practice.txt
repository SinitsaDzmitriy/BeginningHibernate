    Use surrogate keys and let Hibernate generate new values

    The main advantage of a surrogate primary key (or technical ID) is that it is
one simple number and not a combination of multiple attributes as most natural
keys. All involved systems, mainly Hibernate and the database, can handle it very
efficiently. Hibernate can also use existing database features, like sequences or
auto-incremented columns, to generate unique values for new entities.

    technical - формальный
    surrogate - суррогатный, искусственный
    to involve - вовлекать, задействовать

    Specify natural identifier

    You should specify natural identifiers, even if you decide to use a surrogate
key as your primary key. A natural identifier nevertheless identifies a database
record and an object in the real world. A lot of use cases use them instead of an
artificial, surrogate key. It is, therefore, good practice to model them as
unique keys in your database. Hibernate also allows you to model them as a
natural identifier of an entity and provides an extra API for retrieving them
from the database.
    The only thing you have to do to model an attribute is a natural id, is to
annotate it with @NaturalId.
