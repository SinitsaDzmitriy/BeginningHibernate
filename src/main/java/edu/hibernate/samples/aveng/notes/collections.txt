    Naturally Hibernate also allows persisting collections. These persistent collections
can contain almost any other Hibernate type, including basic types, custom types,
embeddables, and references to other entities. In this context, the distinction between
value and reference semantics is very important. An object in a collection might be
handled with value semantics (its lifecycle being fully dependant on the collection
owner), or it might be a reference to another entity with its own lifecycle. In the
latter case, only the link between the two objects is considered to be a state held by
the collection.

    to persist - сохранять (продолжать существование)
    a distinction - разница, отличие
    семантика - смысловое значение
    In the latter case, ... -  В последнем случае, ...
    to consider - рассматривать, считать
    to be considered to be - считаться

    The owner of the collection is always an entity, even if the collection is defined
by an embeddable type. Collections form one/many-to-many associations between types so
there can be:
    - value type collections
    - embeddable type collections
    - entity collections
