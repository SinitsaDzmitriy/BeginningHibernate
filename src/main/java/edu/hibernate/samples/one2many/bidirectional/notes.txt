    The bidirectional @OneToMany association also requires a @ManyToOne association
on the child side. Although the Domain Model exposes two sides to navigate this
association, behind the scenes, the relational database has only one foreign key
for this relationship.
    Every BIDIRECTIONAL association must have one owning side only (the child
side), the other one being referred to as the inverse (or the mappedBy) side.

to expose - выставлять, подвергать действию (предоставлять)
behind the scenes - за кулисами
to refer - ссылаться
inverse - противоположный
